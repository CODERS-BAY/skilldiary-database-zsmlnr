<hr>

Today we have learned from the Database(modelling and the logic). It was really fun. We have to build a Database of the Coders.Bay using the Entity Relationship Model and the Cardinality.

<br>

### Entity Relationship Model

<hr>

* Entity
  * Describes an Object (Keyboard)
* Relationship
  * Describes the relation between Entitys (Gest-(visiting)-Party)
* Attribut
  * Describe the species from an Entity/Relationship (Student(name:varchar))

<br>

### Cardinality
<hr>

Cardinality describes the number of Relationships between the Entitys.
* Men-1---married---1-Women
* Son-N---have---1-Mother
* Home-1--having--N-Rooms
* Student-n--having--m-Classmates
<br>
Entitys can have more Relationships.
